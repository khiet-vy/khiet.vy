                  After many trials of fitting in new places, I realised the place I once rejected is the place that accepts me. I do have a place to call home which is Vietnam. It’s where I was born, where I lived until 10 before leaving, where so many memories were created that I smile when I think about them, where Phở and Bún Bò Huế are treasures when abroad.
